This is the README for testing


I am adding this to develop
Then I will commit to develop
Then I will merge to release
Then I will commit to realease
Then I will push origin develop
Then I will push origin release

Victory

Note:
Build a git_merge wrapper function to the develop->release motion
Unless more care needs to be taken
